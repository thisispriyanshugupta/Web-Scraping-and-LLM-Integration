# Web Scraping and Content Comparison Tool

## Overview
This tool automates web content extraction, compares it with summaries generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), and stores results in a database. It enhances efficiency in content analysis and summarization tasks.

## Key Features
- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes BeautifulSoup and Selenium for extracting text and images from specified URLs.
- **Content Comparison:** Integrates with Hugging Face's LLM API to generate and compare summaries.
- **Database Integration:** Stores scraped content, LLM-generated summaries, and comparison results in SQLite.
- **Screenshot Capture:** Captures web page screenshots during scraping for reference.

## Technologies Used
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- Hugging Face Transformers (LLM integration)
- SQLite (Database management)
- ChromeDriver (Headless browsing and screenshot capture)

scraped_content = scrape_content(html_content)

# Generate LLM summary
llm_summary = generate_llm_summary(scraped_content)

print(f"Scraped Content:\n{scraped_content}\n")
print(f"LLM Generated Summary:\n{llm_summary}\n")
